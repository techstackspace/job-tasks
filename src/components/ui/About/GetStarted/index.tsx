          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            We created Billia because we saw a real problem: people struggling
            with too many apps, missed due dates, and unreliable payment
            platforms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            So we built one app that brings it all together â€” electricity,
            internet, school fees, airtime, and even a virtual dollar card. Add
            Billia AI, and you've got the smartest payment experience available
            today.
